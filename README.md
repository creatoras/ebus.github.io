# [ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd-configuration) Configuration Files
This is a service providing configuration files for ebusd on [a github pages](https://ebus.github.io/cfg/) and/or CDN basis to address the increasing demand for those.

The CSV files currently consumed by ebusd are generated from TypeSpec source files found in the [`src` folder of ebusd-configuration](https://github.com/john30/ebusd-configuration/tree/master/src) and converted to CSV using the [eBUS TypeSpec library](https://github.com/john30/ebus-typespec). The conversion process is described there in detail.

The mapping from source files to generated CSV files is also re-generated with each update and [documented here](mapping.md).
